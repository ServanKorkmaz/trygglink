You are editing an existing Next.js + Tailwind codebase. Keep all routes, API handlers, data logic and filenames intact. Make a UI-only refactor to achieve a clean, trustworthy dark interface similar to VirusTotal, but WITHOUT the “Search” section.

Scope:
- UI ONLY. Do not change business logic, API calls, DB code, or route structure.
- Keep component imports/exports compatible. Avoid breaking props.
- Keep existing page URLs the same.

Design requirements:
- Dark theme with subtle blue accents, rounded corners (Tailwind), generous spacing, focus states, and accessible contrast.
- Centered main card on desktop, full-width on mobile. Responsive and keyboard-accessible.
- Top tab bar with exactly two tabs: **“URL”** and **“Fil”**. No third tab.
  - URL tab: label = “Lim inn en lenke for å sjekke om den er trygg”, input placeholder = “https://…”, primary button = “Sjekk nå”.
  - Fil tab: drag-and-drop area with text = “Last opp en fil for å skanne”, secondary button = “Velg fil”.
- Allow swipe/gesture switching between tabs on mobile (e.g., using pointer/touch events). Also support keyboard switching (Left/Right).
- Remove any “Search” UI/section completely.
- Footer text (centered, small): “TryggLink.no – kun en indikasjon, ikke en garanti”.

Copy & localization:
- All visible UI text MUST be Norwegian. Code/comments can stay in English.
- Create a simple i18n map (e.g., /lib/i18n/nb.ts) and read strings from there so text is centralized.

Components to (re)structure (non-breaking):
- <Tabs> (URL/Fil) with ARIA attributes, focus ring, and swipe support.
- <UrlForm> (input + “Sjekk nå” button) – DO NOT change its submit handler signature.
- <FileDropzone> (drag & drop + “Velg fil”) – keep the onChange/onDrop shape intact.
- <ResultCard> placeholder styles only (do not change its props).
- <Header> with simple logo/wordmark and <Footer> with disclaimer.

Tailwind:
- Use utility classes only. Do not introduce CSS frameworks beyond Tailwind.
- Add color tokens via tailwind.config if needed (dark bg, subtle blue accent).

Accessibility:
- Proper labels/aria-* for inputs and tabs.
- Visible focus states.
- Tab order must be logical.

Deliverables:
- Updated components/pages with the new dark UI.
- New Tabs component with keyboard + swipe support.
- nb.ts file with Norwegian strings used across the UI.
- No TypeScript errors, no prop/route breaking changes.

Acceptance criteria:
- App renders with a VirusTotal-like dark look.
- Exactly two tabs (URL/Fil) and they are switchable by click, keyboard, and swipe.
- All visible strings are Norwegian.
- “Search” UI is gone.
- Existing URL and file submit handlers continue to work as before.
